This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset. The goal is to estimate median house values based on key features such as location (latitude and longitude), number of rooms, population, median income, and housing-related statistics.

📌 Project Workflow

Data Cleaning
Handled missing values, removed inconsistencies, and prepared the dataset for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables to understand important price-driving factors.

Feature Engineering & Selection
Selected relevant features and applied necessary transformations such as scaling and encoding where required.

Model Training
Implemented a regression-based machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression / Random Forest / etc.) to predict house prices.

Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using regression metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

🚀 Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the complete machine learning workflow — from raw data preprocessing to model evaluation — while building a predictive system that estimates housing prices with high accuracy.

This project showcases skills in:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Regression modeling

Model evaluation

Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib
